# Mr. Chili Cheese

Jokingly developed application to ~~coerce~~ convince my partner to go with me to a sketchy and potentially non-existent chili cheese restaurant I found on Google Maps.

Front-end only React project built with Vite and styled with basic CSS. It builds locally by running `npm run dev`.
